# GWAS-software-pipeline
A software pipeline for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
The software pipeline conducts a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). It runs a linear or logistic regression in order to identify genetic variants being associated with a quantitative or a binary trait. The pipeline also includes two methods (GCTA-COJO and PLINK-CLUMP) for the identification of independent genetic variants, i.e. variants which are in linkage equilibrium.
